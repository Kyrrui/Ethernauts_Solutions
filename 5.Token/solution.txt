TOKEN SOLUTION

Using remix, deploy the provided contract using the token contract address.

call the transfer function with the player address and any amount of tokens.

=========================
This works because UINT is an Unsigned Integer, meaning it can never be a negative number, so the require statement is meaningless. As long as you use a seperate contract to call
transfer with a value, even if that contract has no tokens,
your address will recieve those tokens.
