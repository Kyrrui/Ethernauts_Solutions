DELEGATION SOLUTION

Here we want to access the function pwn() in the Delegate
contract. To do this we need to send the FUNCTION SIGNATURE of 
the method we wish to call. To determine this signature, you must
run Keccak256 on the function. 
Here it would be Keccak256(pwn())
But a more sophisticaed method would look like this
Keccak256(pwn(uint, bool));
Once you have this Keccak hash, take the first 4 bytes (8 bits)
and add a 0x to the begining. This is the function signature.
Here we will call the contract with this function signature and take control of the contract.
(The function signature of pwn() is 0xdd365b8b)

In web console run:
sendTransaction({data:"0xdd365b8b", to:"CONTRACT_ADDRESS"})
